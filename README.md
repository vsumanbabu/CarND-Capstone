## Architecture

### Waypoint Updater Node

This package contains the waypoint updater node: `waypoint_updater.py`. The purpose of this node is to update the target velocity property of each waypoint based on traffic light and obstacle detection data. This node will subscribe to the `/base_waypoints`, `/current_pose`, `/obstacle_waypoint`, and `/traffic_waypoint` topics, and publish a list of waypoints ahead of the car with target velocities to the `/final_waypoints` topic.

### Twist Controller Node

Carla is equipped with a drive-by-wire (dbw) system, meaning the throttle, brake, and steering have electronic control. This package contains the files that are responsible for control of the vehicle: the node `dbw_node.py` and the file `twist_controller.py`, along with a pid and lowpass filter that you can use in your implementation. The dbw_node subscribes to the `/current_velocity` topic along with the `/twist_cmd` topic to receive target linear and angular velocities. Additionally, this node will subscribe to `/vehicle/dbw_enabled`, which indicates if the car is under dbw or driver control. This node will publish throttle, brake, and steering commands to the `/vehicle/throttle_cmd`, `/vehicle/brake_cmd`, and `/vehicle/steering_cmd` topics.

### Traffic Light Detector Node

This package contains the traffic light detection node: `tl_detector.py`. This node takes in data from the `/image_color`, `/current_pose`, and `/base_waypoints` topics and publishes the locations to stop for red traffic lights to the `/traffic_waypoint` topic.

The `/current_pose` topic provides the vehicle's current position, and `/base_waypoints` provides a complete list of waypoints the car will be following.

You will build both a traffic light detection node and a traffic light classification node. Traffic light detection should take place within `tl_detector.py`, whereas traffic light classification should take place within `../tl_detector/light_classification_model/tl_classfier.py`.

## Installation

Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

### Docker Installation
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container using docker-compose
```bash
docker-compose build
```

Access to the docker using docker-compose
```bash
docker-compose exec ros bash
```

### Port Forwarding
To set up port forwarding, please refer to the [instructions from term 2](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77)

### Usage

1. Clone the project repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone.git
```

2. Install python dependencies
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Make and run styx
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
4. Run the simulator

### Real world testing
1. Download [training bag](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic_light_bag_file.zip) that was recorded on the Udacity self-driving car.
2. Unzip the file
```bash
unzip traffic_light_bag_file.zip
```
3. Play the bag file
```bash
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_file/traffic_light_training.bag
```
4. Launch your project in site mode
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone/ros
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```
5. Confirm that traffic light detection works on real life images
